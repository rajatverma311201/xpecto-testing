  "description": "The ML based event that will address the issue of crop monitoring that farmers face every day. It is up to you to create an algorithm and an ML model for a given dataset, which will put your analytical, logical thinking, and coding skills to the test. Farmers all around the world have vast acreages and confront the challenge of crop monitoring on a regular basis. To design an algorithm that would assist them in monitoring their crops and in informing farmers about crop health. There is a device available that monitors the crops automatically and takes photos at regular intervals that would aid them in monitoring their crops and sends the data to farmers and advise them about their crop health.\nAccording to health, it will classify diseases. To assist with this, you must construct a\nmachine learning model that classifies diseases.\nTo assist you, we’ll be providing you with a dataset with four classifications; now it's up\nto you to design an ML model.",

Though there are many advancements in the plains like metro networks, Electric Vehicles and others, the scenario in these hilly terrains remained at the roads. It might be a bit easy for local people to reach the far places in these hills and valleys, but for visitors, the connectivity is again a big challenge. The time required for reaching the destination too is quite a challenge due to the structure of the road.\nLet the inner engineer in you handle this by creating an efficient solution which saves a lot of transportation time, increases connectivity and puts a smile on a lot of faces.",
